# Cancer-Skin-Classification

This repository is part of my end of degree project in Mathematics, in which I had to solve a skin cancer classification problem using 
deep convolutional neural networks. The data I used can be found in the repository. I hope this project helps other people who can find it 
useful in areas such as image classification or neural network training.

The RGB csv that contains all the images cannot be uploaded (more than 25MB of data), so I will leave the following url here in case 
someone wants to use it.
