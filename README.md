# Cancer-Skin-Classification

This repository is part of my end of degree project in Mathematics, in which I had to solve a skin cancer classification problem using 
deep convolutional neural networks. The data I used can be found in the repository. I hope this project helps other people who can find it 
useful in areas such as image classification or neural network training.
